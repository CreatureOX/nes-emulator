    |||+-++++- PPU open bus. Returns stale PPU bus contents.
    ||+------- Sprite overflow. The intent was for this flag to be set
    ||         whenever more than eight sprites appear on a scanline, but a
    ||         hardware bug causes the actual behavior to be more complicated
    ||         and generate false positives as well as false negatives; see
    ||         PPU sprite evaluation. This flag is set during sprite
    ||         evaluation and cleared at dot 1 (the second dot) of the
    ||         pre-render line.

    |          a nonzero background pixel; cleared at dot 1 of the pre-render
    |          line.  Used for raster timing.

               Set at dot 1 of line 241 (the line *after* the post-render
